# üîÆ Amaze - Survival Maze Game

## Find the Exit. If It Exists.

Welcome to your new reality - cold, shifting walls and the creeping realization that nothing here wants you to leave. The rules are simple: keep moving, keep breathing, and try not to wonder what happened to the others who came before you.

### What Awaits You

**CORE COMPONENTS:**

1. **Two zones of existence** (the others remain...unfinished. Or hidden):
    
    - `tutorial` - the last comforting lie
        
    - `winter` - where the maze begins to show its true nature
        
2. **Potion system** - your only defense against what lurks in the dark
    
3. **Physics-based inventory** - where every item might be your last
    

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è**ZONES OF NO RETURN**

The maze reveals its secrets reluctantly. What we know:

### **Tutorial**

"Your first and last taste of safety"  
**Exit Condition**:  
Find the passage to **Winter** by:

1. Learning basic movement (WASD) and brewing fundamentals
    
2. Solving a **multi-path puzzle** with help from "one strange gnome" üôÉ
    
3. ...if you're lucky
    

### **Winter**

"Information remains scarce. Those who survive rarely speak of it"

**Core Threat**:

- **The cold kills** ‚Üí Slowly, relentlessly, without the Potion of Cold Immunity.
    

## **üß™ALCHEMY SYSTEM**

Here, potion-making isn't science - it's desperate ritual. Three stages between life and whatever comes after.

#### **Stage 1: Ingredient Processing**

- **Location**: Alchemy Table
    
- **Action**:  
    Take a raw ingredient ‚Üí Prepare it properly ‚Üí Extract what you need  
    _Example: "Frog ‚Üí Processed ‚Üí Frog Heart"_
    

#### **Stage 2: Base Preparation**

- **Location**: Alchemy Table
    
- **Action**:
    
    1. Combine water + herbs ‚Üí Steep for **1-2 in-game(or not...) days**
        
    2. Add processed ingredient to the mixture
        
    3. Wait. And hope.
        

#### **Stage 3: Final Brewing**

- **Location**: Cauldron
    
- **Action**:
    
    1. Transfer mixture to cauldron
        
    2. **Mouse-controlled stirring** while **watching the temperature**
        
    3. One mistake ruins everything
        

#### **Scene Flow**

- **Full-screen view** switches between:
    
    - Alchemy Table (Stages 1-2)
        
    - Cauldron (Stage 3)
        

## **üéí Inventory System**

#### **Pocket Structure**

- **Two physical pockets**:
    
    - `LEFT POCKET` ‚Üí Displayed on **left screen edge**
        
    - `RIGHT POCKET` ‚Üí Displayed on **right screen edge**
        
- **Interaction**:  
    Clicking a pocket reveals **only what's inside that pocket**
    

#### **Item Behavior**

- **Placement**:
    
    - Items **maintain their exact position and rotation**
        
    - No convenient grids or snapping
        
- **Physics**:
    
    - **Gravity** affects items
        
    - **Sprinting risk**: Small chance items may **fall out** of pockets
        
    -  Everything you carry can be **lost**
